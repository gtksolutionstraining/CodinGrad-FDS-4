ProblemStatement--> Managing Users, Admins and Books of a Library manually through excel books

Solution:--> Building a software which will manage users, admins and books of the library.

Software Paradigms: Engineering
    1. Functional Programming : The software drives from the functions
    2. Imperative Programming : The Software drives from Logic
    3. Declerative Programming : Commands
    4. Object Oriented Programming : Objects ==> SOLID Principles

Our Solution: Functional Programming using Files 

TechStack: Python Programming Language, Collections, JSON files.

Engineering:
    1. Agile


A Programmer is called Good if he is good at debugging.

OutComes:
1. You should be familiar with Control Flows 
    1. Conditional Flows
    2. Iterative Flows
        1. While
        2. For Loops
    3. Functions
        1. You should be able to split the logic
        2. You should be able to organize the functions
2. Functional Programming --> System Design
3. Business Value Proposition
    1. You should be able write a initial software which should be scalable.
4. You should be able write fast code.

** Note: The LMS project's code base is scalable. But Data Schema is not scalable.

=> We need to shift our data schema from files to DBMS.
    1. MongoDB - semi-structured
    2. Postgresql - structured
    3. MySQL - structured
