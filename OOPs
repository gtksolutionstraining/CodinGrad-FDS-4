Its a Programming Style
This Programming Style drives from data.

Advantages:
1. Scalable
2. Extendable
3. Robustness
4. Security & Privacy --> Each component is private to itself
5. Isolation   ---> Isolated components   
6. Integration --> Relationship between components
7. Mainatainbility

Disadvatages:
1. Hard to learn, hard to write.

Component: Entity: Class

--> Blueprint --> Is defined by properties and actions of the entity
--> Class is a blueprint. --> Logical Entity 
--> Object is an instance of a class --> Physical Entity

--> OOP is a style of programming and our most focus is on defining and organizing objects efficiently.

OOPs Concepts:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Member Variables
4. Member Functions
5. Encapsulation
6. Abstraction
7. Inheritance
8. Static Polymorphism
9. Dynamic Polymorphism

Member Variables --> Attributes --> Parameters --> Fields --> Columns --> Variables --> Features --> Properties --> Properties of an entity

Member Functions --> Actions of an entity

4 Blocks of memory --> Stack, Heap, Global, Static
** Variables --> Stack
** functions --> Stack
** Recursion --> Stack --> Stack Overflow
** All objects stored in Heap Area of the RAM
