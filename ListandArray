List --> LinkedList --> Non Continuous Memory --> need not be a same data type
Array --> Continuous memory allocation with same data type

Accessing Complexity:
    ** n is the number of elements
    1. List --> O(n) 
    2. Array --> O(1)

Insertion Complexity:
    ** n is the number of elements
    1. List --> O(1)
    2. Array --> O(n)
